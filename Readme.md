# Lookup Editors for Windows Forms - How to filter a second Lookup column based on a first LookUp column's value within a Grid Control

In v16.1 and higher, a standalone Lookup editor allows you to automatically filter its popup data source based on the value of another standalone Lookup editor. See the following topic for more information: [Cascading Lookups](https://documentation.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/116018/Controls-and-Libraries/Editors-and-Simple-Controls/Lookup-Editors/Cascading-Lookups).

This example demonstrates how to filter a Lookup editor's data source based on another Lookup editor's value when the editors are embedded in cells of a container control (for instance, a [Grid Control](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.GridControl)). The code handles the [ShownEditor](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Base.ColumnView.ShownEditor) event to accomplish this task.
